class GOAPWorldState

description:
	This is used to store unique elements with varying value types. Logic is performed on these world states in
	order for agents to find plan of actions to perform.

public member variables:
	None

constructors:

	GOAPWorldState()
		default. No elements exist.

	GOAPWorldState(GOAPWorldState other)
		copies all the other elements values.

public methods:

	bool CreateElement(string name, object value)
		This will try to create and add a new WorldData with a name and value. If the string is the same as 
		an already existing element, then it will fail and not create a new element.
		returns true if successful, false if unsuccessful.

	void AddOtherWorldState(GOAPWorldState otherState)
		For each element in otherState, this will create a new element with the same values.

	List<string> GetNames()
		returns a List of each element name

	void SetElementValue(string name, object value)
		Sets the element value at "name" with the "value" param.

	WorldData GetData(string name)
		Searches for the WorldData with "name" and returns it.

	object GetElementValue(string name)
		Searches for the WorldData with "name" and returns the value.

	Type GetElementValue<Type>(string name)
		Searches for the WorldData with "name" and returns the value and casts it to Type.

	bool CompareValue(GOAPWorldState comparator, string name)
		Compares a specific value between two GOAPWorldStates and checks if they are Equal.

	bool CheckState(GOAPWorldState comparator)
		Compares each value in the comparator to check if all the comparator's values are equal to this.
		This function's primary use is to check if a given GOAPWorldState meets the preconditions of an 
		action, and to check if a temp State in the GOAPPlanner matches the goal State it is searching for.

public static methods:

	static GOAPWorldState CombineWithReferences(GOAPWorldState first, GOAPWorldState second)
		This function will create a new GOAPWorldState and combine the first and second states together.
		The new GOAPWorldState will contain WorldData which are references to the first and second.


class WorldData

public member variables:

	string name
		The name of this element in GOAPWorldState.

	object value
		The value of this element in GOAPWorldState.

constructors:

	WorldData(string name, object value)
		Sets name and value.

public methods:

	Type ConvertValue<Type>()
		Casts value into Type and returns it.

	void SetDefaultValue<Type>()
		Assigns value using the keyword default.
