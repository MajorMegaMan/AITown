abstract class GOAPAction

description:
	This is the base of all GOAPActions and is used to create a plan from the GOAPPlanner and add effects to
	GOAPWorldStates.

protected member variables:

	GOAPWorldState preconditions
		Used to check if action is usable.

	GOAPWorldstate effects
		Currently not actually used in goap as AddEffects is userdefined. But it can be very helpful for
		debugging purposes.

	string name
		Name of this action

	int weight
		Weight of this action. Used to compare for the lowest weight when creating a plan.

constructors:

	GOAPAction()
		Default. Creates an action with new preconditions and new effects

public methods:

	GOAPWorldState GetPreconditions()
		returns a copy of preconditions.

	GOAPWorldState GetEffects()
		returns a copy of effects.

	string GetName()
		returns name.

	int GetWeight()
		returns weight.

abstract methods:

	void AddEffects(GOAPWorldState state)
		This function will be user defined to apply logic and add effects to "state" the GOAPWorldState
		that was passed as a param. This is essential to the GOAPPlanner running.

public enum ActionState
	completed
		action has finished performing.
	performing
