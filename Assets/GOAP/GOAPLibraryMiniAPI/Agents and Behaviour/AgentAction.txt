additional

public abstract methods:

	ActionState PerformAction(GOAPAgent<GameObjectRef> agent, GOAPWorldState worldState)
		User defined performing action. Variables can be referenced from "agent". For example position.
		Values can also be used from worldState which is this agent's worldState.

	bool EnterAction(GOAPAgent<GameObjectRef> agent)
		User defined values can be set here for when an agent first assigns it's current action.
		For example an agent needs to assign it's action's target's position before it can walk there.
		(This function is horribly named. But the idea is it first enters the action when it is popped from
		 the agents plan.<queue>)

	bool IsInRange(GOAPAgent<GameObjectRef> agent)
		User defind distance check for if the agent is in range.
		simply return true if the agent can perform this action at any location.

public virtual methods:

	bool CanPerformAction(GOAPAgent<GameObjectRef> agent, GOAPWorldState worldState)
		User can override this function if they want additional logic to check if an agent is still able 
		to perform it's action when navigating.
		Should always call the base. as it performs a check state with preconditions.
